# Linux
Trying to learn some bash scripting and to automate some of the processes coming up I'll need to get a few fresh installs going.
Of course I guess I could just make a fresh image and use that as a template too using VMware but here I am making scripts!

The main goal is to focus on a Distro and make it easier to get stuff going quicker without remembering a billion different things.

As I grow as a bash scripter so will the scripts, hopefully they will become better and work flawlessly. Right now it appears that I've been working more with Rocky Linux so that will be the focus for now.

Eventually, I may end up working more with some more Ubuntu based scripts again.
