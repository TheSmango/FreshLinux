# FreshLinux
Trying to learn some bash scripting and to automate some of the processes coming up I'll need to get a few fresh installs going.
Of course I guess I could just make a fresh image and use that as a template too using VMware but here I am making scripts!


DNF will mean like RPM distros
DEB will mean like DEB based distros
